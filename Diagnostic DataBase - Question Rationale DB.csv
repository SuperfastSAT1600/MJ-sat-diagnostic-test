Diagnostic Test V2,RW,2,객관식,B,50,"Is tentatively exploring whether ""opaque"" could metaphorically apply to the complexity of the system but has clear doubts.",🔴
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,2,객관식,B,75,"Is considering ""opaque"" as a serious contender, possibly misinterpreting the term as meaning complex rather than unclear.",🔴
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,2,객관식,B,100,"Mistakenly thinks ""opaque"" accurately conveys the nature of coral reef interactions, misunderstanding both the word and the passage.",🔴
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,2,객관식,C,0,"Fully understands that ""abstract"" doesn’t fit with the specific, tangible examples given in the passage.",🔴
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,2,객관식,C,25,Is unsure and might be misled by the idea that ecological concepts can sometimes be abstract.,🔴

Diagnostic Test V2,RW,3,객관식,A,0,"The choice of this answer suggests no understanding of the contextual use of ""answer""; it implies a complete misreading, perhaps interpreting it in its common Q&A sense, unrelated to satisfying a need.",🔴
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,3,객관식,A,25,"This level of confidence indicates some familiarity with “answer” meaning “explain,” but applying it here shows a surface-level reading that misses the deeper demand-response relationship in the sentence.",🔴
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,3,객관식,A,50,"There is partial recognition of the contextual tension between early AI models and modern demands, but the choice still wrongly equates “answer” with “clarify,” suggesting an incomplete grasp.",🔴
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,3,객관식,A,75,"With this confidence, the student may have weighed ""clarify"" against other choices but ultimately failed to align “answer” with “satisfy,” reflecting a misinterpretation of intent.",🔴
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,3,객관식,A,100,"The student is highly confident but completely wrong, likely due to overgeneralizing the most familiar meaning of “answer” without reconsidering its metaphorical use in a more technical or formal context.",🔴
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,3,객관식,B,0,This choice shows no understanding of how “answer” functions in context; “support” is not a logical synonym here and represents a misalignment with the passage’s tone.,🟡
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,3,객관식,B,25,"The student may associate “support” with the idea of technology, but this reflects a misunderstanding of the specific relationship described between AI models and modern demands.",🟡
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,3,객관식,B,50,"Some contextual awareness is evident, but interpreting “answer” as “support” suggests the student confuses aiding technology with fulfilling its evolving requirements.",🟡
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,3,객관식,B,75,"The student likely interprets “support” as a rough equivalent of “respond to,” which is partially true, but still misses the nuance that the AI must meet the needs, not just help them.",🟡
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,3,객관식,B,100,"The student shows strong confidence in a superficially plausible but ultimately incorrect meaning, perhaps due to conflating ""support"" with fulfilling or enabling — close, but imprecise.",🟡
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,3,객관식,C,0,"This indicates no understanding of the phrase “answer the demands,” mistaking it for confrontation; it reflects a major disconnect from the intended meaning.",🟢
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,3,객관식,C,25,"The student recognizes some tension between AI and modern tech but incorrectly sees “answer” as implying opposition, showing a misreading of the tone.",🟢
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,3,객관식,C,50,"This suggests a guess based on the idea that outdated models might ""go against"" demands — a confusion between lagging behind and actively resisting.",🟢
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,3,객관식,C,75,"There’s awareness of the mismatch between AI and modern needs, but ""challenge"" misrepresents the passive failure to meet demands as active opposition.",🟢
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,3,객관식,C,100,The student seems sure that “challenge” fits because they misread the passage’s criticism as combative; confidence reflects misunderstanding the word’s role in the sentence.,🟢
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,3,객관식,D,0,This shows no grasp of the idiomatic meaning of “answer the demands”; “satisfy” was likely not considered or understood.,🔴
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,3,객관식,D,25,"The student has partial insight into the expectations of modern technology and might suspect “satisfy” fits, but lacks full comprehension of the phrase.",🔴
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,3,객관식,D,50,"There is growing awareness that “answer” means fulfilling a need, and choosing “satisfy” at this level suggests cautious but correct reasoning.",🔴
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,3,객관식,D,75,This shows near-complete understanding; the student likely weighed “satisfy” against similar terms and judged it as best reflecting the passage’s logic.,🔴
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,3,객관식,D,100,"The student fully grasps that “answer the demands” means “satisfy the demands,” demonstrating precise vocabulary knowledge and contextual reading.",🔴
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,4,객관식,A,0,"They likely misunderstood the word ""quality"" as referring to public opinion or renown, which made them associate it with ""reputation""—but this indicates a misreading of the sentence's structure and how ""boldness"" functions grammatically.",🟡
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,4,객관식,A,25,"They saw a possible connection between ""quality"" and personality and gave ""trait"" a modest chance, though they weren't fully confident—suggesting they were on the right track but unsure of their vocabulary precision.",🟡
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,4,객관식,A,50,"They recognized that ""trait"" was probably correct based on context clues and partial understanding of how “boldness” functions, but still hesitated—likely due to test pressure or second-guessing.",🟡
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,4,객관식,A,75,"They strongly grasped the meaning of ""quality"" in this context and were mostly certain that it meant “trait,” with only minor doubts possibly due to previous confusion on similar vocabulary questions.",🟡
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,4,객관식,A,100,"They were fully confident that “quality” referred directly to a personal characteristic, correctly identifying ""trait"" as the best synonym and understanding the function of the word in the sentence.",🟡
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,4,객관식,B,0,"They incorrectly focused on how people might view Earhart rather than what defined her internally, thinking “reputation” referred to others’ perception instead of her own trait—showing a misunderstanding of the sentence's structure.",🟢
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,4,객관식,B,25,"They gave “reputation” some consideration due to the connection between legacy and public image, but weren't committed—indicating some recognition that “reputation” might not fit precisely.",🟢
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,4,객관식,B,50,"They leaned toward “reputation” because of Earhart’s fame but also noticed that the sentence described her personal characteristics, suggesting a conflicting interpretation of the word “quality.”",🟢
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,4,객관식,B,75,"They mostly believed that “reputation” was what the sentence meant, possibly because of the word “inspiring,” but overlooked that “boldness” referred to something intrinsic, not how others viewed her.",🟢
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,4,객관식,B,100,"They were completely confident that “quality” meant “reputation,” but this reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the sentence—mistaking an internal characteristic (boldness) for an external perception.",🟢
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,4,객관식,C,0,"They knew “achievement” didn’t quite fit but were unsure about the others, so they guessed it might be related to her accomplishments in aviation—revealing a surface-level association rather than a close contextual read.",🔴
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,4,객관식,C,25,"They thought “achievement” might loosely work since boldness helped Earhart reach goals, even if the word didn’t match perfectly, indicating a vague understanding and uncertainty in vocabulary nuance.",🔴
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,4,객관식,C,50,"They thought “achievement” was likely correct because they saw “pushing boundaries” and “inspiring pilots” as accomplishments, though this misses the fact that “quality” refers to an internal attribute.",🔴
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,4,객관식,C,75,"They were fairly confident “achievement” worked, likely because of the surrounding ideas about Earhart’s impact, though they failed to see that “boldness” described how she did things, not what she did.",🔴
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,4,객관식,C,100,"They were absolutely sure that “achievement” matched the sentence, likely because of the words “challenge” and “inspiring”—but they misunderstood the sentence’s grammar, thinking the quality named a result, not a trait.",🔴
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,4,객관식,D,0,They weren’t convinced by “standard” at all and guessed it only because they had no better option—suggesting confusion about what the question was even asking.,🔴
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,4,객관식,D,25,"They found “standard” vaguely related to expectations and influence, so they gave it minor consideration, though it was mostly a shot in the dark.",🔴
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,4,객관식,D,50,"They believed “standard” might relate to how Earhart set expectations or norms for others, but this reflects a misreading—confusing personal traits with societal benchmarks.",🔴
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,4,객관식,D,75,"They thought “standard” was probably what the sentence meant, linking it to the idea of Earhart raising the bar, though they failed to notice that “boldness” is not a measurable guideline.",🔴
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,4,객관식,D,100,"They fully believed “standard” matched the idea of Earhart influencing norms in aviation, showing a complete misreading of the sentence and a confusion between internal traits and external expectations.",🔴

Diagnostic Test V2,RW,5,객관식,D,0,"The choice rejects the idea of hostility, which is valid, since the sea is depicted as gentle and cyclical.",🔴
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,5,객관식,D,25,"The choice shows minimal belief in the sea’s hostility, perhaps influenced by the erasure image, but misses the poem’s soft tone.",🔴
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,5,객관식,D,50,"The choice suggests moderate belief in a destructive portrayal of nature, but this overlooks the poem’s calm and resigned atmosphere.",🔴
Diagnostic Test V2,RW,5,객관식,D,75,"The choice shows strong confidence in an antagonistic view of the sea, misreading the poem’s tone and gentle imagery.",🔴
