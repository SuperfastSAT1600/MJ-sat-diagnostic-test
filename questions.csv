One of the biggest challenges in large  open spaces&mdash;such as concert halls and conference centers&mdash;is controlling distortion caused by sound waves reflecting off distant surfaces. Engineers at an audio technology firm have developed a new acoustic panel system that  they hypothesize  will significantly reduce distortion and improve clarity by absorbing certain frequencies and preventing unwanted echoes. To test this hypothesis  the engineers set up two identical sound systems in a large  acoustically untreated auditorium  with one system equipped with the new acoustic panels and the other remaining unmodified  and had both systems play a series of complex soundscapes&mdash;such as spoken word  classical music  and high-frequency electronic tones&mdash;while researchers recorded clarity  distortion levels  and audience perception.</p>,<p>Which finding from the tests  if true  would most strongly support the engineers&rsquo; hypothesis?</p>,<p>The sound system with the acoustic panels required less power to maintain the same decibel level as the system without the panels.</p>,<p>The sound system with the acoustic panels resulted in a noticeable increase in reverberation times compared to the system without the panels.</p>,<p>The sound system with the acoustic panels produced significantly clearer and more distinguishable audio across a range of frequencies than the system without the panels.</p>,<p>The sound system with the acoustic panels had a slight delay in audio transmission compared to the system without the panels.</p>,A,RW,multiple_choice
12,<p data-start="225" data-end="835">Discovered in early 2025  the asteroid 2025PX exhibits an unexpected acceleration that cannot be fully attributed to the gravitational forces of nearby planetary bodies. Scientists have ruled out conventional explanations such as collision-induced momentum shifts or gravitational interactions with undetected objects. Instead  a team of researchers led by Dr. Helena Cortez proposes that the acceleration is caused by the sublimation of trapped methane within the asteroid&rsquo;s rocky-icy composition. According to Cortez and her colleagues  exposure to solar radiation gradually heats the asteroid&rsquo;s surface  releasing methane gas that had been embedded within ice pockets. This outgassing provides a non-gravitational thrust  altering the asteroid&rsquo;s trajectory.</p>,<p>Which statement  if true  would most strongly support the claim made by Cortez and her colleagues about the cause of 2025PX&rsquo;s acceleration?</p>,<p>Models of outgassing in small celestial bodies have previously accounted for the sublimation of nitrogen and carbon dioxide  but some inconsistencies remain in their ability to predict acceleration patterns.</p>,<p>The trajectory of 2025PX contradicts the pattern expected if the acceleration were caused by methane sublimation  but an alternative explanation could be that the asteroid contains significant amounts of ammonia ice.</p>,<p>The magnitude of 2025PX&rsquo;s acceleration is comparable to the minor deviations observed in other asteroids  which can generally be explained by gravitational perturbations alone.</p>,<p>Laboratory simulations indicate that cosmic radiation can create embedded pockets of methane in ice over millions of years  and observational data confirm that 2025PX experienced solar heating sufficient to release this methane.</p>,A,RW,multiple_choice

14,<p data-start="225" data-end="835">Scientists studying Mars&rsquo;s atmosphere have debated whether methane (CH₄) could serve as a biosignature gas  indicating past or present biological activity on the planet. Dr. Alan Wescott and his team analyzed methane levels detected by rovers and orbiters and concluded that while methane could  in some cases  be a byproduct of microbial life  it could also result from non-biological processes such as geological activity. Additionally  their research found that certain temperature and pressure conditions unique to Mars&rsquo;s subsurface could allow methane to accumulate in the absence of life. Therefore  Wescott&rsquo;s team argued that while methane could be considered a biosignature gas under specific circumstances  its mere presence in the Martian atmosphere is not sufficient to conclude that life once existed there.</p>,<p>Based on the text  Wescott and his team would most likely agree with which statement about methane on Mars?</p>,<p>Its presence is more likely to indicate geological activity than biological activity.</p>,<p>Its absence from a planet suggests that life has never existed there.</p>,<p>It should only be considered a biosignature gas if detected in conditions that do not allow for non-biological methane production.</p>,<p>&nbsp;It is unlikely to reach high enough concentrations in planetary atmospheres to be considered a biosignature gas.</p>,A,RW,multiple_choice
16,<p>A study conducted by Dr. Lena Patel and colleagues in 2020 recorded approximately 2 million migratory birds crossing the central flyway in North America  nearly twice the number reported in a 1998 study by Dr. Samuel Becker. This difference is partly attributed to advancements in radar technology  which now allow for more precise tracking of bird movement. However  another factor is that species classification methods have changed over time  particularly for smaller songbirds  where slight variations in plumage and call patterns may result in them being classified as distinct species rather than as variations within a single species. Such classification choices have a significant impact on overall species counts. In fact  both studies reported similar counts of large raptors and waterfowl  suggesting that ______</p>,<p>Which choice most logically completes the text?</p>,<p>Patel and colleagues reported a significantly higher number of species than Becker largely due to the inclusion of species that were not identified in 1998.</p>,<p>Some differences observed in songbirds may have been classified as variations within a species by Becker but classified as distinct species by Patel and colleagues.</p>,<p>Becker may have been less sensitive to the degree of within-species variations than Patel and colleagues were.</p>,<p>The lack of clarity regarding how to differentiate among bird species may have caused Patel and colleagues to underestimate the number of migrating species.</p>,A,RW,multiple_choice
