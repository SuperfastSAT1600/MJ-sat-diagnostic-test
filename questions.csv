2,"<p>Text 1<br>Mycoprotein is a fungal biomass that can be eaten as an alternative to meat. Studies of the environmental impact of its manufacture generally agree it is lower than that of beef and closer to that of chicken or pork. But the expense of producing mycoprotein restricts its availability to a few countries with postindustrial economies. Knowing that cost reductions would expand access to mycoprotein, biochemists are exploring solutions, such as a cheaper substrate to feed the mycoprotein as it grows.</p> <p>Text 2<br>Cattle farming is a principal cause of global deforestation, and a study by Florian Humpen&ouml;der and his colleagues found that replacing 20% of beef consumption worldwide with consumption of mycoprotein would cut deforestation by half if accomplished over the next thirty years. However, this would likely involve only a small change in agricultural water consumption, since water once dedicated to raising cattle would be diverted to raising crops instead.</p>","<p>Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 1 most likely respond to the study findings mentioned in Text 2?</p>","<p>By emphasizing that since agricultural water consumption would remain static in the event of replacing beef consumption with mycoprotein consumption, an effort must be made to substitute mycoprotein for chicken and pork in diets as well</p>",<p>By asserting that the development of a more inexpensive substrate for mycoprotein production would contribute to the goal of decreasing worldwide deforestation over time</p>,<p>By noting that most people would be more likely to use mycoprotein as a substitute for chicken or pork in their diets than as a substitute for beef</p>,"<p>By pointing out that some countries are responsible for greater deforestation than others and thus, to have any significant effect on the environment, will have to replace more than 20% of their beef consumption with mycoprotein</p>",B,RW,multiple_choice
3,"<p>The following text is adapted from Indian Boyhood, a 1902 memoir by Ohiyesa (Charles A. Eastman), a Santee Dakota writer. In the text, Ohiyesa recalls how the women in his tribe harvested maple syrup during his childhood.</p> <p>Now the women began to test the trees&mdash;moving leisurely among them, axe in hand, and striking a single quick blow, to see if the sap would appear. The trees, like people, have their individual characters; some were ready to yield up their life-blood, while others were more reluctant. Now one of the birchen basins was set under each tree, and a hardwood chip driven deep into the cut which the axe had made. From the corners of this chip&mdash;at first drop by drop, then more freely&mdash;the sap trickled into the little dishes.</p>",<p>Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?</p>,<p>It portrays the range of personality traits displayed by the women as they work.</p>,<p>It foregrounds the beneficial relationship between humans and maple trees.</p>,<p>It demonstrates how human behavior can be influenced by the natural environment.</p>,<p>It elaborates on an aspect of the maple trees that the women evaluate.</p>,D,RW,multiple_choice
4,"<p>Elizabeth Asiedu has identified a negative correlation between the share of developing countries&rsquo; economies derived from natural-resource extraction and those countries&rsquo; receipts of foreign investment. This may appear counterintuitive&mdash;resource extraction requires initial investments (in extractive technology, for instance) at scales best met by multinational corporations&mdash;but Asiedu notes that natural-resource industries&rsquo; boom-bust cycle can destabilize local currencies and increase developing countries&rsquo; vulnerability to external shocks, creating levels of uncertainty to which foreign investors are typically averse.</p>",<p>Which choice best states the main idea of the text?</p>,"<p>Although it may seem surprising that foreign investment declines in developing countries as natural-resource extraction makes up a larger share of those countries&rsquo; economies, that decline happens because resource extraction requires initial investments too large for foreign investors to supply.&nbsp;</p>","<p>Although developing countries tend to become less dependent on foreign investment as natural-resource industries make up a larger share of their economies, this change may not occur if the boom-bust cycle of those industries destabilizes local currencies or increases countries&rsquo; vulnerability to external shocks.&nbsp;</p>","<p>Although one might expect that foreign investment would increase as natural-resource extraction makes up a larger share of developing countries&rsquo; economies, the opposite happens because heavy reliance on natural resources can lead to unattractive conditions for investors.</p>","<p>Although foreign investors tend to avoid initial investments in natural-resource industries in developing countries, foreign investment may increase significantly as those industries stabilize and the risks associated with them decline.</p>",C,RW,multiple_choice
5,"<p>Marta Coll and colleagues&rsquo; 2010 Mediterranean Sea biodiversity census reported approximately 17,000 species, nearly double the number reported in Carlo Bianchi and Carla Morri&rsquo;s 2000 census&mdash;a difference only partly attributable to the description of new invertebrate species in the interim. Another factor is that the morphological variability of microorganisms is poorly understood compared to that of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and algae, creating uncertainty about how to evaluate microorganisms as species. Researchers&rsquo; decisions on such matters therefore can be highly consequential. Indeed, the two censuses reported similar counts of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, suggesting that ______</p>",<p>Which choice most logically completes the text?</p>,<p>Coll and colleagues reported a much higher number of species than Bianchi and Morri did largely due to the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri&rsquo;s census.</p>,<p>some differences observed in microorganisms may have been treated as variations within species by Bianchi and Morri but treated as indicative of distinct species by Coll and colleagues.</p>,<p>Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to the degree of morphological variation displayed within a typical species of microorganism than Coll and colleagues were.</p>,<p>the absence of clarity regarding how to differentiate among species of microorganisms may have resulted in Coll and colleagues underestimating the number of microorganism species.</p>,B,RW,multiple_choice
